# EC2 Automation Toolkit

This repository contains a toolkit for automating the process of running EC2 instances on AWS, cloning a repository within the EC2 instances, executing code, performing specific tasks, saving results within the EC2 instances, and terminating the instances. The purpose of this toolkit is to streamline the deployment and execution of code within EC2 instances, enabling efficient and scalable workflows for various applications.

## Features

- **EC2 Instance Provisioning**: The toolkit provides functions to provision EC2 instances on AWS with customizable parameters, such as AMI ID, instance type, security groups, and key pair. This allows for the easy creation of instances tailored to specific requirements.

- **Repository Cloning**: Once the EC2 instances are provisioned, the toolkit facilitates cloning a repository onto each instance. This enables seamless access to the codebase and any required dependencies within the EC2 environment.

- **Code Execution**: The toolkit includes utilities to execute code or scripts within the EC2 instances. This can be useful for running tests, performing data processing tasks, or executing any desired operations.

- **Task Execution and Results**: You can define specific tasks to be performed within the EC2 instances using the toolkit. This could involve running a specific function, executing a script, or performing any other necessary operations. The toolkit also provides functionality to save and retrieve results within the EC2 instances.

- **Instance Termination**: Once the task is completed, the toolkit offers a simple way to terminate the EC2 instances. This ensures efficient resource management and helps avoid unnecessary costs.

## Getting Started

To use the toolkit, follow these steps:

1. Set up your AWS credentials: Ensure that you have valid AWS credentials configured, either through environment variables, AWS CLI configuration, or an AWS credentials file. This will enable your code to interact with the AWS services.

2. Configure the toolkit: Modify the configuration file to specify the desired parameters for EC2 provisioning, repository cloning, code execution, and task details. Customize the settings according to your specific requirements.

3. Run the code: Execute the main script, which orchestrates the entire workflow. This script will provision the EC2 instances, clone the repository onto each instance, execute the specified code or commands, perform the defined task, and save the results within the instances.

4. Retrieve and analyze results: Once the task is completed, retrieve the results from the EC2 instances for further analysis or processing. Modify the code as needed to handle the retrieval of results and any post-processing steps required.

5. Terminate instances: To avoid incurring unnecessary costs, use the provided functionality to terminate the EC2 instances once the task is finished. This ensures efficient utilization of resources.
